# Investigating the social web*

_*A working title_


## About
_Investigating the Social Web_ is an instructional text book that is aimed to provide its readers with an understanding of the kind of data that can be mined from the social web, of the insights that can be gained from it, and of the limitations of its scope.

Each lesson and  exercise is written with the understanding that social media, the web and technology are in constant flux.

This repository holds code and data related to the exercises detailed in the book.

#### Data files

While most coding files are hosted on this repository some data files were too large to be included her. Below are instructions on how to access them:


- `askscience_submissions.csv` — This file is required for the data exercises in chapter 8 and 9. If you're working with a downloaded version of this repository, you will need to first create a `data` inside the `chapter08_09` folder, then download the data file `askscience_submissions.csv` and, lastly, place the data file inside the `data` folder. You can download the file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vvm6doirfuasux2/askscience_submissions.csv?dl=0). The data was provided by data archivist Jason Baumgartner and represents a small sliver of the data he makes available to academics and researchers at [Pushshift.io](https://pushshift.io/).

- `iranian_tweets_csv_hashed.csv` — This file is required for the data exercises in chapter 10. If you're working with a downloaded version of this repository, you will need to first create a `data` inside the `chapter10` folder, then download the data file `iranian_tweets_csv_hashed.csv` and, lastly, place it inside the data folder. You can download the file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6vidcpzgg3na3cg/iranian_tweets_csv_hashed.csv?dl=0) or directly from [Twitter](https://storage.googleapis.com/twitter-election-integrity/hashed/iran_201901_1/iran_201901_1_tweets_csv_hashed.zip). You can find more information about this data on Twitter's [elections integrity page](https://about.twitter.com/en_us/values/elections-integrity.html#data).
